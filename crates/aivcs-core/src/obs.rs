//! Structured observability hooks for AIVCS run lifecycle events.
//!
//! This module provides:
//! - Run-scoped tracing spans via `RunSpan` RAII guard
//! - Emission functions for key lifecycle events: start, event append, finish, gate evaluation
//!
//! Events are emitted at `info!` level (configurable via `AIVCS_LOG` env var).
//! For JSON output, set `AIVCS_LOG_FORMAT=json`.
